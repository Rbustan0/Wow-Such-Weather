# Wow-Such-Weather

## Description
This repository is designed to showcase the ability to create an website with a framework (in my case I used bulma), while being able to fetch the api's needed to be able to present the current weather as well as the future five day forecast. The user needs to be able to input a location so that the information populates, and needs to be able to click on a previous search on the side to be able to review the information that they were given about a previous city.

## Installation
* Most recent version of VS code or access to Github Repository link
* Potentially a key for Openweather API usage


## Extensions/API's Used

### Extensions:
* DayJS
* Jquery
* Bulma

### OpenWeather Content:
* Geolocate API doc
* Current Weather Data API doc
* 5 day / 3 hour Forecast API doc

## Usage

User can check out how bulma differs from Bootstrap in the html. The user can also observe Jquery implementation as well as observe how DayJS converts unix timestamps. They can also comment out the console logs to see how the data is being logged and what I am grabbing from the fetch calls.
